// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Take the first number provided an assign to the variable (a).
Take the second number provided and assign to the variable (b).
Take (a) and use plus operator to add (b)and get the sum.

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Take the number provided and divided by 2.
If the answer is zero then the number is even.
If the answer is not 0 then the number is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

A) Take each number provided and assign each number to a variable using the alphabet.
B) Using the addition operator get the sum of variable A+B+C+D+E = sum. Divide the sum by 5. Round down.
C) Check if A is bigger than B, if true. Assign A to Largest number variable. If false Assign to Smallest letter variable. Continue to check through list of letters and compare with largest and smallest variables.
D) Ğ°=5, b=10, c=13, d=1, e=20
   a+b+c+d+e = 49 / 5 = 9
   
   a>b=false, 
   a=smallest number, 
   b=largest number, 
   b>c=false, 
   b>smallest number(a)=true, 
   c>d=true, 
   c>largest number=true, 
   c=largest number, 
   d>e=false, 
   d>smallest number=false, 
   d=smallest number, 
   e>largest number=true, 
   e=largest number
   Print largest number = (e)20
   Print smallest number = (d)1
